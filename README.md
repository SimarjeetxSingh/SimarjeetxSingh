Hello,
More about me- 
A tech enthusiast and a creative soul on a mission to make the world a better place through technology, faith, and the rhythm of life. As a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Giani Zail Singh Campus College of Engineering and Technology, Bathinda, I've been honing my technical skills and cultivating a profound understanding of the intricacies of computer science.

My journey has been an exciting blend of spirituality, creativity, and academic pursuits. With a strong belief in the divine and a love for coding and dance, I've discovered that pursuing my passions brings immense happiness and fulfillment.</p>

On the technical front, I've honed my skills in various programming languages, including C++, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. Throughout my academic journey, I've eagerly taken on challenges, consistently striving for excellence in both theoretical knowledge and practical application. I believe that creativity and logic go hand in hand in problem-solving and innovation.

Beyond the realms of technology, I find solace on the volleyball court, where friendly competition and teamwork teach me valuable life lessons about discipline, collaboration, and striving for success as a team. Dancing, especially the vibrant art form of Bhangra, connects me with my culture and provides an outlet for expressing my emotions.

My vision is to utilize my coding skills to contribute to innovative projects that have a positive impact on the world. With an unwavering belief in God, I approach life with humility, empathy, and gratitude, cherishing the opportunities that come my way.

I'm eager to connect with like-minded individuals and potential collaborators as I embark on this exciting journey. Together, let's make the world a better place, one line of code and one Bhangra step at a time. As I continue to tread the path of education and self-discovery, I am open to exploring new opportunities and challenges in the tech industry, where I can apply my skills and passion to create meaningful innovations.
